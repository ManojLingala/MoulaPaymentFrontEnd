# PaymentApp

PaymentAPP FrontEnd

Run the server side code(MoulaTechnicalAssessment) and configure the api_URL in environment.ts (front end code)

Go to the solution folder 

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The reason for implementing  two solution is because of  loosely couple behaviour as
which makes the application independent and can be changed to any technology in later point of time .


The second reason for opting different solution is because which makes the application looks less messy 
when it grows.
